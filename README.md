# AUV-Catalog
## Website is part of a data analysis project related to quadcopter components using the Amazon API.
### Purpose of the Website and Project
This website serves as an informational hub for an academic research project conducted under the guidance of Dr. Taylan Topcu and Dr. Andrea L'Afflitto in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Virginia Tech. The project is focused on building an advanced catalog system for the assembly and optimization of quadcopter subsystems.

Project Goals:
Component Analysis and Selection: Develop a rule-based system to identify and select subsystem components based on attributes like weight, cost, and delivery time.
Alternative Exploration: Utilize commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products to provide alternative options for each subsystem, ensuring diversity and cost-effectiveness.
Custom Solutions: Highlight instances where components need to be custom-built due to the absence of suitable COTS options.
Research Significance:
The project is a part of ongoing research at Virginia Tech, aiming to create a systematic and scalable approach to evaluate and select quadcopter components for optimized assembly. By integrating product search APIs, the system can provide real-time data, enabling informed decision-making in component selection.

Intended API Use:
The Amazon Product Advertising API will be utilized to:

Retrieve alternative product options for various quadcopter subsystem components.
Compare key characteristics such as weight, cost, delivery time, and availability.
Maintain traceability of product sources by linking directly to product pages.
This project is essential for enhancing the efficiency of assembly processes and supporting educational efforts in system engineering and design optimization.
